# UMSAP
Utilities for Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Proteins (UMSAP) is a graphical user
interface designed to speed up the post-processing of data obtained during mass spectrometry studies involving proteins. The program is not intended to analyze a mass spectrum or a mass chromatogram, neither to identify the peaks in a mass spectrum. The main objective is the fast post-processing of the vast amount of data generated in mass spectrometry experiments involving proteins after peak identification have been performed.
