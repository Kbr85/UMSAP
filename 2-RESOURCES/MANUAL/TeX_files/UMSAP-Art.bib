@article{Larson1983,
abstract = {The promoter-proximal gene (glpT) of the glpT-glpQ operon of Escherichia coli encodes a membrane permease responsible for active transport of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. Promoter-distal glpQ encodes a periplasmic protein which is not required for active transport of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (Larson, T.J., Schumacher, G., and Boos, W. (1982) J. Bacteriol. 152, 1008-1021). This periplasmic protein has now been identified as a phosphodiesterase which hydrolyzes glycerophosphodiesters into sn-glycerol 3-phosphate plus alcohol. The enzyme exhibited broad substrate specificity with respect to the alcohol moiety; sn-glycerol 3-phosphate was released from glycerophosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoglycerol, and bis(glycerophospho)glycerol. The enzyme was specific for glycerophosphodiesters; bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate, a substrate for other phosphodiesterases, was not hydrolyzed. In a coupled spectrophotometric assay utilizing sn-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and NAD, apparent activity was optimal at pH 9 and was stimulated by Ca2+. The substrates of the phosphodiesterase had no affinity for the glpT-encoded active transport system. Thus, the glpQ gene product expands the catabolic capability of the glp regulon to include a variety of glycerophosphodiesters.},

abstract = {Mass accuracy is a key parameter of mass spectrometric performance. TOF instruments can reach low parts per million, and FT-ICR instruments are capable of even greater accuracy provided ion numbers are well controlled. Here we demonstrate sub-ppm mass accuracy on a linear ion trap coupled via a radio frequency-only storage trap (C-trap) to the orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap). Prior to acquisition of a spectrum, a background ion originating from ambient air is first transferred to the C-trap. Ions forming the MS or MS(n) spectrum are then added to this species, and all ions are injected into the orbitrap for analysis. Real time recalibration on the "lock mass" by corrections of mass shift removes mass error associated with calibration of the mass scale. The remaining mass error is mainly due to imperfect peaks caused by weak signals and is addressed by averaging the mass measurement over the LC peak, weighted by signal intensity. For peptide database searches in proteomics, we introduce a variable mass tolerance and achieve average absolute mass deviations of 0.48 ppm (standard deviation 0.38 ppm) and maximal deviations of less than 2 ppm. For tandem mass spectra we demonstrate similarly high mass accuracy and discuss its impact on database searching. High and routine mass accuracy in a compact instrument will dramatically improve certainty of peptide and small molecule identification.},

abstract = {Although only a few years old, the combination of a linear ion trap with an Orbitrap analyzer has become one of the standard mass spectrometers to characterize proteins and proteomes. Here we describe a novel version of this instrument family, the Orbitrap Elite, which is improved in three main areas. The ion transfer optics has an ion path that blocks the line of sight to achieve more robust operation. The tandem MS acquisition speed of the dual cell linear ion trap now exceeds 12 Hz. Most importantly, the resolving power of the Orbitrap analyzer has been increased twofold for the same transient length by employing a compact, high-field Orbitrap analyzer that almost doubles the observed frequencies. An enhanced Fourier Transform algorithm-incorporating phase information-further doubles the resolving power to 240,000 at m/z 400 for a 768 ms transient. For top-down experiments, we combine a survey scan with a selected ion monitoring scan of the charge state of the protein to be fragmented and with several HCD microscans. Despite the 120,000 resolving power for SIM and HCD scans, the total cycle time is within several seconds and therefore suitable for liquid chromatography tandem MS. For bottom-up proteomics, we combined survey scans at 240,000 resolving power with data-dependent collision-induced dissociation of the 20 most abundant precursors in a total cycle time of 2.5 s-increasing protein identifications in complex mixtures by about 30{\%}. The speed of the Orbitrap Elite furthermore allows scan modes in which complementary dissociation mechanisms are routinely obtained of all fragmented peptides.},

Before performing the analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS), nanoelectrospray-MS/MS (NanoES-MS/MS) or liquid chromatography-MS/MS (LC-MS/MS), the peptide mixtures need to be cleaned, concentrated and often selectively enriched or pre-fractionated, for which we employ simple, self-made and extremely economical stop-and-go-extraction tips (StageTips). StageTips are ordinary pipette tips containing very small disks made of beads with reversed phase, cation-exchange or anion-exchange surfaces embedded in a Teflon mesh. The fixed nature of the beads allows flexible combination of disks with different surfaces to obtain multi-functional tips. Disks containing different surface functionalities and loose beads such as titania and zirconia for phosphopeptide enrichment can be combined. Incorporation into an automated workflow has also been demonstrated. Desalting and concentration takes approximately 5 min while fractionation or enrichment takes approximately 30 min.},

abstract = {Electrospray ionization has recently emerged as a powerful technique for producing intact ions in vacuo from large and complex species in solution. To an extent greater than has previously been possible with the more familiar "soft" ionization methods, this technique makes the power and elegance of mass spectrometric analysis applicable to the large and fragile polar molecules that play such vital roles in biological systems. The distinguishing features of electrospray spectra for large molecules are coherent sequences of peaks whose component ions are multiply charged, the ions of each peak differing by one charge from those of adjacent neighbors in the sequence. Spectra have been obtained for biopolymers including oligonucleotides and proteins, the latter having molecular weights up to 130,000, with as yet no evidence of an upper limit.},

@article{Krojer2008a,
abstract = {All organisms have to monitor the folding state of cellular proteins precisely. The heat-shock protein DegP is a protein quality control factor in the bacterial envelope that is involved in eliminating misfolded proteins and in the biogenesis of outer-membrane proteins. Here we describe the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulated protease and chaperone function of DegP from Escherichia coli. We show that binding of misfolded proteins transforms hexameric DegP into large, catalytically active 12-meric and 24-meric multimers. A structural analysis of these particles revealed that DegP represents a protein packaging device whose central compartment is adaptable to the size and concentration of substrate. Moreover, the inner cavity serves antagonistic functions. Whereas the encapsulation of folded protomers of outer-membrane proteins is protective and might allow safe transit through the periplasm, misfolded proteins are eliminated in the molecular reaction chamber. Oligomer reassembly and concomitant activation on substrate binding may also be critical in regulating other HtrA proteases implicated in protein-folding diseases.},

Protein quality control involves molecular chaperones, folding catalysts, and proteases that are often heat shock proteins. One quality control factor is HtrA, one of a new class of oligomeric serine proteases. The defining feature of the HtrA family is the combination of a catalytic domain with at least one C-terminal PDZ domain. Here, we discuss the properties and roles of this ATP-independent protease chaperone system in protein metabolism and cell fate.},

Before performing the analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS), nanoelectrospray-MS/MS (NanoES-MS/MS) or liquid chromatography-MS/MS (LC-MS/MS), the peptide mixtures need to be cleaned, concentrated and often selectively enriched or pre-fractionated, for which we employ simple, self-made and extremely economical stop-and-go-extraction tips (StageTips). StageTips are ordinary pipette tips containing very small disks made of beads with reversed phase, cation-exchange or anion-exchange surfaces embedded in a Teflon mesh. The fixed nature of the beads allows flexible combination of disks with different surfaces to obtain multi-functional tips. Disks containing different surface functionalities and loose beads such as titania and zirconia for phosphopeptide enrichment can be combined. Incorporation into an automated workflow has also been demonstrated. Desalting and concentration takes approximately 5 min while fractionation or enrichment takes approximately 30 min.},
